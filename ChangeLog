	* Turn off the generation of 8.3 filenames per default, keep it
	accessible with a global. Discourage its use.

	* Do not ignore symlinks anymore. Ignoring them is not the right
	policy: either forbid or list them in the CHECKSUMS file. Up to
	now a directory that contained only a symlink, remained without
	CHECKSUMS file, which is stupid and makes (unstoppable) noise in
	CPAN.pm.

	* drieux at wetware.com reports that the manpage is missing a
	prerequisites section. Added now.

	* Return 1 after deleting CHECKSUMS in an empty (or otherwise not
	indexed) directory. We used to return without argument.

2000-12-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig@anima.de>

	* Delete CHECKSUMS if directory is empty. 

	* Skip symlinks. Symlinks are considered inappropriate in CPAN
	author directories. They violate the principle of a one to one
	relationship between filename and file.

	* Releasing as 1.003
	
	* original version; created by h2xs 1.19
