	* Return 1 after deleting CHECKSUMS in an empty (or otherwise not
	indexed) directory. We used to return without argument.

	* Delete CHECKSUMS if directory is empty. 

	* Skip symlinks. Symlinks are considered inappropriate in CPAN
	author directories. They violate the principle of a one to one
	relationship between filename and file.
