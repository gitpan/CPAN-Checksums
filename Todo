	* running updateddir on all 4012 checksummed directories on CPAN takes a
	hell lot of time (over an hour) and slows other processes down, so I
	wonder where the time is spent. If it were ungzip, we could lax our
	interest to only computing it for files that have a new ungzip checksum
	or so ($SKIP_UNGZ_IF_GZ_UNCHANGED or so).

	But if we can make sure that updatedir is always run after a change
	(both upload and delete), we can run the whole find/update thing just
	once a week. For now I have reduced it to every 6 hours so I can
	investigate changes better.
